Python GUI Implementation for SkyAR Library
Python GUI Implementation for SkyAR Library
Introduction
SkyAR is an augmented reality library in Python that allows developers to create AR applications. In this project, we will create a GUI implementation for SkyAR using PyQt5 or tkinter.
Requirements
Python 3.x
SkyAR library
PyQt5 or tkinter library
Installation
You can install SkyAR library using pip:

pip install SkyAR

For PyQt5 installation, use the following command:

pip install PyQt5

Implementation
We will create a simple GUI application that allows the user to select an image and display it using SkyAR. The GUI will have a button to select the image, and a canvas to display the augmented reality.
